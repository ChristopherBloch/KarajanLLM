Aria Brain — Legacy main.py reference.

The original monolithic 2,340-line main.py was replaced with a modular
architecture in commit ae70277 (2026-02-07).  All endpoints are preserved
identically in routers/*.py sub-modules.

To view the old code:
    git show ae70277~1:src/api/main.py

This stub exists solely as a pointer.  The live entry point is main.py.
